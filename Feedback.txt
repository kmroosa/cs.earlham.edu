/people/OVERVIEW

  [Kate] I think we could do without the well here.

/applied_groups/GREEN_SCIENCE

  [Kate] There appears to be a CSS problem so that the content box for Green Science 
  is not long enough to interact with the arrow at the sidebar. Could we make 
  all of the boxes (for all content groups) a standard size? Are we going to link from
  current pages to the individual group sites/pages or are we allowing them to edit on
  the current pages?
  
 /jobs/OVERVIEW
 
  [Kate] Could we split this page into 2? In other sections, the overview page is
  just the overview with text and I suppose pictures at some point. Should we do 
  that here and have another page in the left sidebar for "student positions"?
  Instead of the wells under each tab, maybe an accordian would be useful as a list
  of the jobs available with a small amount of hidden space for a brief description.
